//! Post-toggle confirmation dialog for screen-capture protection.
//!
//! Shown the moment the user enables `Block screenshots` in Settings →
//! Advanced. The whole purpose: catch the case where the user is on a
//! remote-desktop session (or any other capture-relaying setup) and
//! enabling protection has just hidden the window from them. If they
//! can read the dialog, they click OK and the setting sticks. If they
//! can't (because the window is now invisible to their capture), the
//! 5-second timeout reverts protection automatically and they regain
//! control.
//!
//! The settings handler builds an [`iced::Task::abortable`] sleep,
//! hands the [`iced::task::Handle`] to [`ScreenshotConfirmModal::open`],
//! and dispatches the resulting Task. Closing the modal (or replacing
//! the handle on a fresh open) drops the prior `Handle`, whose
//! `abort_on_drop` cancels the in-flight sleep — so the only `Timeout`
//! message that ever reaches the handler is one whose modal is still
//! open.
