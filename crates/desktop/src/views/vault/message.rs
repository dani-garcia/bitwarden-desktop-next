//!
//! Variants whose payloads are large or sensitive use the [`NoDebug`] /
//! [`Summary`] wrappers from [`crate::debug_fmt`] so the enum just derives
//! `Debug` instead of hand-rolling per-variant formatters. iced warns when
//! a `Message`'s `Debug` takes >1 ms — the load-test account's 20k-cipher
//! `ListLoaded` measured ~31 ms with the derive default, hence `Summary`
//! on the bulk variant; `DetailLoaded` / `SaveCompleted` carry decrypted
//! ciphers, hence `NoDebug`.
