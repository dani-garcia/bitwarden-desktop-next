// ── Top-level Message ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// `View` carries sub-view messages (all need `UpdateCtx`, factored into one
// shared construction site). The rest are app-level signals.
//
// `derive_more::From` generates `From<VariantType> for Message` for every
// tuple variant *except* `View(ViewMessage)` — that one's skipped because
// the blanket below already covers `T: Into<ViewMessage>` (and the reflexive
// `From<ViewMessage> for ViewMessage` would otherwise produce a duplicate
// impl). `Window(WindowMessage)` is also skipped because its handler routes
// per-window-id rather than via a single typed conversion.
