//! Context bundles injected into view `update()` and `view()` calls, plus
//! the [`Outcome`] return type that every view `update()` produces.
//!
//! - [`UpdateCtx`] — for `update()`. Exposes SDK + session + the app-level
//!   overlay cell. Components MUST NOT receive it — rendering never spawns
//!   SDK work. The layer boundary lives in the type system: `components/`
//!   cannot reach `UpdateCtx`.
//! - [`RenderCtx`] — for `view()`. Render-time state (theme colors, favicon
//!   service, active user/email/accounts, layout hints, currently-open
//!   overlay). Components may receive it.
//! - [`Overlay`] — names every app-level overlay. Single source of truth so
//!   opening one replaces the previous by construction. Login vs. vault
//!   account switcher share a variant because only one view is visible at a
//!   time (mutex via `Screen`).
//! - [`Outcome`] — view `update()` return shape. `None` / `Task(t)` /
//!   `Event(e)`. The "both task and event" case is excluded — enrich the
//!   event so App's handler fires both effects.
